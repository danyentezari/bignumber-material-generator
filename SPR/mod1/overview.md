# Module 1 Overview 

In module 1, we will look at how statistical and probabilistic techniques are used in different domains â€“ from healthcare to finance to engineering and other disciplines. We will also look at how machine learning evolved from the science and mathematics of statistics.

In the next section, we're going to look at statistical inference at the high level.
